                        that have been

                        successfully completed
                        your puzzles. By giving a pat on the back, you show appreciation for their effort and celebrate
                        their achievement.
                        This feature enhances the engagement between you and the puzzlers who enjoy your creations.

                        puzzle. This action
                        allows both you and the user to see a green checkmark, indicating that the acknowledgment has
                        been given. Itâ€™s a
                        great way to motivate and encourage puzzle solvers while recognizing their accomplishments.
